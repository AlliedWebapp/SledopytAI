DESCRIPTION:-
This Project revolves around the clone of Zen-desk. In this project, I have created a simple CRM (Customer Relational  Management) application. Where we can create our account and also create our employees to solve the tickets raised by the customers. we can also assign an employee to each ticket to solve the customer query. Also, Employees who were created by the admin can log in to their  account with the created login email ID and password. In the Employee field, the employee can view the tickets assigned to him and also change the status of the tickets.

Steps:-

Step 1: On the home page, click the Start free trial button to register your account with the original email ID. Bcoz you will get a verification mail to verify the user.
